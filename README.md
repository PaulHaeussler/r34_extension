# r34_extension

This is a custom private project. I have a database containing r34 tags my script is watching. To know what tags I'm already watching and which ones  to add (if they're any good)
this extensions fetches the names of all tags already being watched and marks any posts in the search containing these, highlighting which posts are already being watched.
